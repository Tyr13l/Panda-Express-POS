# README
The project centered around a POS system for Panda Express that my team designed to integrate web components. This project included several views, such as a cashier, manager, kitchen, menu board, serving, login, and kiosk views for improved versatility and use. The inclusion of the additional views would allow our system to be incorporated within every aspect of the store. It would assist from the kitchen, to cashiers and managers, as well as the customers themselves. We included several existing APIs to allow for third-party authentication, page translations, time and weather service, and text-to-speech features that helped with both security and accessibility needs for customers and employees.

## Contributions
My main contributions to the project were 
* primary development of the kiosk view, its logic, and its visuals
* manager sales and inventory report logic
* pSQL files and associated python scripts

## Source Code
The main code for each view can be found through demo within server.js, and demo/app
